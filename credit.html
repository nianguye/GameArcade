                        Credit to Caz for the pixel card images used for the blackjack and bacarrat game. 
                         Furthermore, the slots machine was created by Tognee on Github. Both of their links along with their licenses are shown below.
                        The code follows under CC BY-SA 4.0 DEED. For changes, 
                        the key changes was to allow the slot game to fit the format of the other games, which resulted in some changes to the main and body css. The changes were just
                        removal of borders and adjustment of colors and font. Finally, credits to chatGPT for developing the lobby images.
